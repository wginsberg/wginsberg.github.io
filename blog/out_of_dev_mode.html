            <h1>Getting out of dev mode</h1>

            <p>
                If you have ever started a personal project you probably know that it can be really hard to finish.
                This happens to everbody from song writers to web developers to filmmakers.
                People like Paul Graham have already written about the perils of
                <a href="https://paulgraham.com/early.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not finishing stuff</a>
                ; I once spent my own money to take a course called
                <a href="https://benlevinmusicschool.com/p/getting-songs-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Getting Songs Done"</a>.
                I want to examine this idea and try to push it a little further.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    Learning to finish is necessary and great because it forces you to get out of dev mode.
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The most exciting consequnce of this idea is its corollary: You can enjoy (some of) the benefits of finishing just by getting out of dev mode!
            </p>
    
            <h2>What is dev mode?</h2>
            <p>
                I'm using dev mode both literally and figuratively here.
                The literal sense for me specifically has to do with running a ReactJS application using the Vite dev server.
                If you are programming with a different language/framework/platform you likely have some analogous version of my development environment.
                For instance developing an app in Android Studio, or running a RESTful backend service against a local database.
                In all of these cases our development environment affords us some benefits such as quickly seeing the results of code changes without waiting for a full build/deplyment, opportunities for debugging, and isolating our changes from real users.
                The big tradeoff we make here by living in dev mode is that we are somewhat detached from the actual artifact that we will deliver to our users.
                In my case there is a separate build step which results in a different set of HTML/JavaScript/CSS files that will be served from the production web server. Hopefully they will match exactly.
            </p>
    
            <h2>Dev mode in the wild</h2>

            <p>I have encountered a similar phenomenon of the dev mode in contexts outside of programming. Here are some of the ones I can think of:</p>
    
            <h3>Film</h3>
            <p>
                In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sduifFHdlQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">director's commentary for the movie "Blackberry"</a> Matt Johnson talks about the importance of test screenings for the film making process.
                He argues that the point of a test screening is not necessarily to elicit feedback from audience, but rather for the filmmaker to experience the movie with the audience and intuitively feel how the movie is translating to them in the moment.
            </p>
            <p>
                I suppose I could recommend exporting your project and watching it on an actual smartphone to understand how the experience will translate to that environment, though I'm out of my lane here.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Recorded music</h3>
            <p>
                The "dev tool" of music production is the digital audio workstation, or DAW. The way to escape is to "bounce" the project into a simple audio file like an MP3 or WAV file.
                Once we do this a few things start to happen:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We can listen through a variety of different speakers. For better and for worse many people hear music through the speakers on their phone, so we should try it and see how our music translates in that environment. We might quickly realise that we want to make different decissions in terms of arrangement and instrumentation. Why wait until the writing, recording, and mixing is perfected to do that?
                </li>
                <li>
                    We can do a (proper) listening party. The same point about test screenings comes into play here: the experience of simply sitting in a room and listening to your music with a few people will reveal invaluable feedback, even if your other listens don't articulate it to you.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Live music</h3>
            <p>
                When it comes to live music there are a few versions of "dev mode" that I can think of.    
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We may practice a song acoustically or sing without amplification but use some kind amplification when we perform. The use of amplification can drastically change how we approach the performance, and the acoustics of the room will play a role too.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Maybe we rehearse the same song with some degree of improvisation between takes without really committing to a single performance as the "real" version. Once it is performed in front of an audience it is locked in to their memory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Differences in posture: do you practice sitting down and then perform standing up? When you play into the mirror does your gaze focus on yourself but in a live setting do you look around at the audience?
                    These subtle physical differences (in addition to any degree of stage fright) could affect how you play your instrument in subtle ways and change the final product delivered to the listener's ears.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Visual art</h3>
            <p>
                I am no painter but I would think we'd get a substantially different experience when the work is "finished" and framed, hanging on a wall, exposed to the particular lighting of that space, compared to sitting in your workspace.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Writing</h3>
            <p>
                If writing prose is really anything like writing code then it must be true that writers spend more time reading their own writing than they do actually writing it.
                It should follow that writers ought to avoid spending all of their time reading in their text editor and commit their writing to the paper/e-book/webpage media to which it will eventually be published.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Thinking</h3>
            <p>
                To take this idea all the way to its limit, I believe that our inner monologue is the dev mode of articulation.
                We have two tools of articulation that I am aware of: writing and speaking.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                "If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking."
                <cite>â€• Leslie Lamport</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Writing truly allows us to exit the dev mode of our minds by committing our ideas to a physical medium.
                We abruptly short circuit our thought-loops. We recognize our tangents with precision.
                We can spot weakness in our arguments with almost embarassing ease.
                We get to strengthen them in virtuous cycles of thinking, rewriting, editting, before arriving at a refined product that can stand up to the scrutiny of others.
                But even better is that we improve our own conceptions in the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other escape hatch from thinking is speaking. 
                The obvious benefit of speaking is the immediate feedback from a co-particpant in conversation.
                But why let that be an obstacle?
                Try standing in front of the mirror and pitching yourself to a prospective employer, customer, or date.
                You will quickly find both the flaws in how you presented your thoughts out loud, and even realise what you might want to start working on in your life.
            </p>
    
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Dev mode isn't a bad thing!
                Spending time with our tools simply presents us a set of tradeoffs that we should be aware of.
                I encourage everyone to take Paul Graham's advice and to ship early and often.
                Hopefully this article is a bit more encouragement to just that.
                There is also good reason to take a quick shortcut and get out of dev mode without shipping anything.
                Or at least to trick yourself into shipping without realizing that you already did it :)
            </p>
    
            <h3>Bonus: more on dev mode in web development</h3>
    
            <p>
                Some more concrete reasons that we are detached from reality when developing web applications:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Developing even a simple web page locally gives the false impression that your page and all of its resources will load instantaneously.
                    Instead we should realize that each network request could realistically take hundreds of milliseconds.
                    Some optimizing of fonts, images, JavaScript bundles, and critical request chaining might by in order already - if the page load actually results in a terrible user experience then this wouldn't be premature optimization.
                    This will also manifest itself when interativity is involved - loading states or optimistic UI might be non-negotiable at this point.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the real world a website needs to be deployed somewhere, and ideally will have its own domain name. It is easy to forget that you will need to do these things or else you will never be "done", and the act of doing them can give you a feeling of "doneness" with relatively low effort. I recommend keeping it simple, and use a free hosting option like <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Pages</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To reiterate: if you are developing and running a command like <code>npm run dev</code> and you have a separate command like <code>npm run build</code> to build your project you are almost certainly testing an artifact that your users will never interact with.
                    Your build step may break without you realizing it and lead to wasted time trying to understand how fix it. Your CSS may be processed such that the styling breaks between the development version and the production version.
                    Getting out of dev mode means discovering and addressing these kinds of issues earlier before they spiral out of control.
                    (As an aside, my favourite client ever hired a development team who deployed a ReactJS dev server on a virtual machine as their production deployment. They never got out of dev mode!)
